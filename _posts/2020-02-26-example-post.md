Welcome to my personal corner of the internet, where I share the things that light up my life, challenge my mind, and keep me moving forward.

## 🌟 My Favorite Things To Do

### 📚 Reading
Reading is my escape, my passion, and probably where I spend most of my free time. I love diving into different worlds, discovering new ideas, and letting stories shape the way I see life. Whether it's fiction, personal development, or something totally random — I’m all in.

### 🏃‍♀️ Practising Sports
I stay active not only for my health, but because it brings me balance and joy. I especially enjoy pilates, yoga, running, swimming, and playing padel. Moving my body helps me stay focused and gives me energy to enjoy everything else I love.

### 🌍 Learning New Languages
Languages open doors — to people, to cultures, to connection. I love talking to different people and being able to understand strangers. There’s something magical about seeing how language shapes thoughts and values. Plus, it’s just fun!

### ✈️ Travelling
Travel is a big part of who I am. I love exploring new places, learning from different cultures, and being surrounded by nature. It keeps me grounded and curious. Every trip adds a new piece to my story.
